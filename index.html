    + ' First, huge congratulations to my teammate @georgerussell63 for an incredible drive and well deserved first win. I remember how special the first one is and I am so happy for you. I also want to congratulate our amazing team back home in the UK. Everyone has worked so hard this year and I have never been more proud to drive for you, represent you, and fight alongside each and every one of you. We stand together and it means so much to me to be a part of this team win. I hope you enjoy this moment as we work towards many more together. Brasil, you never disappoint and it feels great to give this crowd such a race.'
    + ' Personally I feel for the fans because I remember the period of time when Michael Schumacher was winning. I remember waking up in the morning to watch the start of the race and then going to sleep, and then waking up when it ended because I already knew what would happen. I am pretty sure a lot of people were doing that today'
    + ' I had a difficult time at school. I didn’t realise I was dyslexic until I was 17 and just struggled so much. I was always playing catchup. Everyone should have access to quality education. But shockingly there are still millions of children globally who don’t have access to schools and education. This needs to change.'
    + ' I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I\'m one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can\'t stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you.'
    + ' The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.'
    + ' Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.'
    + ' I have a responsibility as a person of colour. I’ve got a niece and nephew who are growing up biracial and I don’t want them to experience what I experienced. I have this voice, this platform, and it’s not for personal use — it’s for trying to gain traction and push for change.'
    + ' I don\'t allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things. I\'m trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now.'
    + ' I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious. Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.'
    + ' It is actually quite exciting when you’re flying headfirst into a barrier—the initial part, the initial part is actually quite fun, especially when you hit the gravel trap and you get some air, and then you see it coming and you think ‘erk—it’s gonna hurt!'
    + ' I always remind myself if I’m having a down day because of a bad race it’s not just me. That feeling I’m having is shared by my family, the team and my fans. When we win they feel the joy as well. That’s why I say we win and lose together, and I definitely couldn’t do it without them.'
    + ' Nothing can really prepare you for when you get in the Formula One car. Knowing that you’re driving a multimillion-dollar car, and if you crash it it’s going to cost a lot of money, and they might not give you another chance, is scary.'
    + ' I don’t know if you’ve ever been skiing, but if you go to the slope you’ll see all these kids fearlessly zooming by. It’s only when we get older that fear creeps in. But for me, it just never has. And when it comes to racing, it’s always about who is willing to go further, who is willing to take that extra step. I’m willing to take any amount of pain to win. I’m hungry to win.'
    + ' When we win, my family, team. and fans feel the joy as well. That’s why I say we win and lose together, and I definitely couldn’t do it without them.'
    + ' My brother was told that he wouldn’t walk, that he wouldn’t be able to play drums, that he wouldn’t be able to race a car – and he’s done all those things. He’s defied the odds, defied disability. I look at him and I’m so inspired, by his mentality and by how incredible the body and the mind are. There’s really nothing you can’t do. My brother has proved that.'
    + ' I think grooming is definitely undervalued by men. We all expect women to be fully groomed, which they do. But I also think it’s just as important for a man to look fresh and clean.'
    + ' I always thought, if I can affect one kid and help him or her fulfill their dreams, that would be kinda neat, so I want to ensure that I’m remembered in a good way.'
    + ' #blessed. still we rise'
